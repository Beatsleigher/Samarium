# About Samarium

Samarium (named after the lanthanide [Samarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samarium)) is an open (free), plugin-based email archival solution compliant with German data protection laws.

Inspired by a proprietary email archival solution, this software is designed to be open and free (free as in [GNU free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)).

Samarium provides a pure backend solution which can be expanded upon, and exposes interfaces for data retrieval and configuration.
Working together with the tried-and-true [Elastic Stack](http://elastic.co) ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/)), Samarium is fully configurable and provides (optionally) encrypted data archival.
